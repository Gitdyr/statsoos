# Module for PrestaShop: Customer out of stock

## About

This module lists customers who are waiting for out of stock products.

It is possible to delete unwanted entries.

## History

The module was created back in 2012 but seems to work fine with newer
versions of PrestaShop.

## Installation

Download the ZIP file here from GitHub. Unpack the file to the modules
directory in your shop and rename the directory to get rid of the
"-main" part. Now you can install the module from back office.
